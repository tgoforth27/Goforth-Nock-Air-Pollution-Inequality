Data outputs that supports published work titled "Air pollution disparities and equality assessments of US national decarbonization strategies." 

Generation outputs are processed outputs from ReEDS model, emissions are calculated given emissions rates listed in paper, air pollution outputs are from InMAP model and post processing to census level, population weighted air pollution concentrations are calculated by approach listed in paper.
